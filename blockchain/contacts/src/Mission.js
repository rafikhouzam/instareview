        He has a passion for making a difference and using his knowledge to create change.</p>

      <h1 className='missionTitles'>Our mission.</h1>
      <p className='missionDescriptions'>Instareview was created as a step towards honest consumerism. Rafi believed that certain review systems were taking
            advantage of their users, by not having full transparency. One can never know if a review has been created maliciously
            or if it has been bought. By making it decentralized, we believe that we can minimize malice and dishonesty.
